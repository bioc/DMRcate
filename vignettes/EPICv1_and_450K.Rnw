\title{Calling DMRs from EPICv1 and 450K data}

\author{Peters TJ}
\maketitle

\renewcommand{\abstractname}{Summary}
\begin{abstract}
This vignette demonstrates how to call DMRs from older versions of Illumina arrays, namely 450K and EPICv1 (pre-2022). 
\end{abstract}


<<bioconductor, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE>>=
if (!require("BiocManager"))
	install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("DMRcate")
@

Load \texttt{DMRcate} into the workspace:

<<libr, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE>>=
library(DMRcate)
@

For this vignette, we will demonstrate DMRcate's array utility using data from \texttt{ExperimentHub}, namely Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC data from the data packages \texttt{FlowSorted.Blood.EPIC}. Specifically, we are interested in the methylation differences between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.  

<<tcells, message=FALSE>>=
library(ExperimentHub)
eh <- ExperimentHub()
FlowSorted.Blood.EPIC <- eh[["EH1136"]]  
tcell <- FlowSorted.Blood.EPIC[,colData(FlowSorted.Blood.EPIC)$CD4T==100 | 
                                 colData(FlowSorted.Blood.EPIC)$CD8T==100]
@

Firstly we filter out any probes where any sample has a failed position. Then we normalise using \texttt{minfi::preprocessFunnorm}. After this, we extract the \emph{M}-values from the GenomicRatioSet.

<<detpnorm>>==
detP <- detectionP(tcell)
remove <- apply(detP, 1, function (x) any(x > 0.01))
tcell <- preprocessFunnorm(tcell)
tcell <- tcell[!rownames(tcell) %in% names(which(remove)),]
tcellms <- getM(tcell)
@

\textit{M}-values (logit-transform of beta) are preferable to beta values for significance testing via \texttt{limma} since they approximate normality, and provide greater sensitivity towards the extremes of the distribution, but we will use a beta matrix for visualisation purposes later on.

Some of the methylation measurements on the array may be confounded by proximity to SNPs, and cross-hybridisation to other areas of the genome\cite{Pidsley, Chena}. In particular, probes that are 0, 1, or 2 nucleotides from the methylcytosine of interest show a markedly different distribution to those farther away, in healthy tissue (Figure 1). 

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
  \caption{Beta distribution of 450K probes from publicly available data from blood samples of healthy individuals \cite{Heyn} by their proximity to a SNP. ``All SNP probes'' refers to the 153,113 probes listed by Illumina whose values may potentially be confounded by a SNP.
}

\end{figure}

It is with this in mind that we filter out probes 2 nucleotides or closer to a SNP that have a minor allele frequency greater than 0.05, and the approximately 48,000 \cite{Pidsley, Chena} cross-reactive probes on either 450K and/or EPIC, so as to reduce confounding. Here we use a combination of \textit{in silico} analyses from \cite{Pidsley, Chena}.  About 60,000 are removed from our M-matrix of approximately 864,000:

<<filter, message=FALSE>>=
nrow(tcellms)
tcellms.noSNPs <- rmSNPandCH(tcellms, dist=2, mafcut=0.05)
nrow(tcellms.noSNPs)
@


Here we have 6 CD8+ T cell assays, and 7 CD4+ T cell assays; we want to call DMRs between these groups. One of the CD4+ assays is a technical replicate, so we will average these two replicates like so:

<<avearrays>>==
tcell$Replicate
tcell$Replicate[tcell$Replicate==""] <- tcell$Sample_Name[tcell$Replicate==""]
tcellms.noSNPs <- limma::avearrays(tcellms.noSNPs, tcell$Replicate)
tcell <- tcell[,!duplicated(tcell$Replicate)]
tcell <- tcell[rownames(tcellms.noSNPs),]
colnames(tcellms.noSNPs) <- colnames(tcell)
assays(tcell)[["M"]] <- tcellms.noSNPs
assays(tcell)[["Beta"]] <- ilogit2(tcellms.noSNPs)
@

Next we want to annotate our matrix of M-values with relevant information. We also use the backbone of the \texttt{limma} pipeline for differential array analysis. We want to compare within patients across tissue samples, so we set up our variables for a standard limma pipeline, and set \texttt{coef=2} in \texttt{cpg.annotate()} since this corresponds to the phenotype comparison in \texttt{design}. 

\texttt{cpg.annotate()} takes either a data matrix with Illumina probe IDs, or an already prepared GenomicRatioSet from \texttt{minfi}.

<<annotate, message=FALSE>>=
type <- factor(tcell$CellType)
design <- model.matrix(~type) 
myannotation <- cpg.annotate("array", tcell, arraytype = "EPICv1",
                             analysis.type="differential", design=design, coef=2)
@

<<showmyannotation>>=
myannotation
@

Now we can find our most differentially methylated regions with \texttt{dmrcate()}.

For each chromosome, two smoothed estimates are computed: one weighted with per-CpG \textit{t}-statistics and one not, for a null comparison. The two estimates are compared via a Satterthwaite approximation\cite{Satterthwaite}, and a significance test is calculated at all hg19 coordinates that an input probe maps to. After fdr-correction, regions are then aggregated from groups of post-smoothed significant probes where the distance to the next consecutive probe is less than \texttt{lambda} nucleotides.


<<dmrcate, warning=FALSE>>=
dmrcoutput <- dmrcate(myannotation, lambda=1000, C=2)
dmrcoutput
@

We can convert our DMR list to a GRanges object, which uses the \texttt{genome} argument to annotate overlapping gene loci. 

<<ranges, message=FALSE>>=
results.ranges <- extractRanges(dmrcoutput, genome = "hg19")
results.ranges
@

DMRs are ranked by Fisher's multiple comparison statistic, but \texttt{Stouffer} scores and the harmonic mean of the individual component FDRs (\texttt{HMFDR}) are also given in this object as alternative options for ranking DMR significance.

We can then pass this GRanges object to \texttt{DMR.plot()}, which uses the \texttt{Gviz} package as a backend for contextualising each DMR.  


<<plotting, message=FALSE>>=
groups <- c(CD8T="magenta", CD4T="forestgreen")
cols <- groups[as.character(type)]
cols

DMR.plot(ranges=results.ranges, dmr=1, CpGs=getBeta(tcell), what="Beta", 
         arraytype = "EPICv1", phen.col=cols, genome="hg19")
@

Consonant with the expected biology, our top DMR shows the CD8+ T cells hypomethylated across parts of the CD8A locus. The two distinct hypomethylated sections have been merged because they are less than 1000 bp apart - specified by \texttt{lambda} in the call to \texttt{dmrcate()}. To call these as separate DMRs, make \texttt{lambda} smaller.

Lastly, we would like to do a gene ontology test on our DMRs; this is made possible by the \texttt{goregion()} function in the \texttt{missMethyl} package. We will take the top 100 hypomethylated DMRs in CD8+ T cells for this enrichment test.

<<goregion>>=
library(missMethyl)
enrichment_KEGG <- goregion(results.ranges[results.ranges$meandiff < 0][1:100], 
                            all.cpg = rownames(tcell), collection = "KEGG", 
                            array.type = "EPIC")
enrichment_KEGG <- enrichment_KEGG[order(enrichment_KEGG$P.DE),]
head(enrichment_KEGG, 10)
@

From this enrichment test we can see the most enriched terms relate to CD8+ T cell function, including antigen processing and presentation as the top hit, in addition to other infection and immunity terms.
