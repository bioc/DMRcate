DMR identification
}
\description{
  The main function of this package. Computes a kernel estimate
  against a null comparison to identify significantly differentially (or
  variable) methylated regions.
}
\usage{
dmrcate(object, 
           lambda = 1000,
           C=NULL,
           p.adjust.method = "BH", 
           pcutoff = "fdr", 
           consec = FALSE, 
           conseclambda = 10, 
           betacutoff = NULL,
           min.cpgs = 2,
           mc.cores = 1
           ) 
}
\arguments{
  \item{object}{
    A class of type "annot", created from \code{\link{cpg.annotate}}. 
  }
  \item{lambda}{
    Gaussian kernel bandwidth for smoothed-function estimation. Also informs DMR
    bookend definition; gaps >= \code{lambda} between significant CpG sites
    will be in separate DMRs. Support is truncated at 5*\code{lambda}. Default is 1000
    nucleotides. See details for further info.
  }
  \item{C}{
    Scaling factor for bandwidth. Gaussian kernel is calculated where 
    \code{lambda}/\code{C} = sigma. Empirical testing shows that when \code{lambda=1000}, near-optimal prediction of sequencing-derived DMRs is obtained when \code{C} is approximately 2, i.e. 1 standard deviation of Gaussian kernel = 500 base pairs. Cannot be < 0.2.
  }
  \item{p.adjust.method}{
    Method for \emph{p}-value adjustment from the significance test. Default is
    \code{"BH"} (Benjamini-Hochberg).
  }
  \item{pcutoff}{
    \emph{p}-value cutoff to determine DMRs. Default is automatically determined by the number of significant CpGs returned by either \code{limma} or \code{DSS} for that contrast, but can be set manually with a numeric value.
  }
  \item{consec}{
    Use \code{DMRcate} in consecutive mode. Treats CpG sites as equally spaced.
  }
  \item{conseclambda}{
    Bandwidth in \emph{CpGs} (rather than nucleotides) to use when
    \code{consec=TRUE}. When specified the variable \code{lambda} simply
    becomes the minumum distance separating DMRs.
  }
  \item{betacutoff}{
    Optional filter; removes any region from the results that does not have at least one
    CpG site with a beta fold change exceeding this value.
  }
   \item{min.cpgs}{
    Minimum number of consecutive CpGs constituting a DMR.
  }
  \item{mc.cores}{
    When > 1, the processor will attempt to run the kernel smoothing in parallel, 1
    chromosome per core. Use with discretion. Default recommended for laptop use.
    Please use \code{detectCores()} and htop in your terminal to check your resource
    ceiling before increasing the default.
  }
}
\details{

  The values of \code{lambda} and \code{C} should be chosen with care. For array data, we currently recommend that half a kilobase represent 1 standard deviation of support (\code{lambda=1000} and \code{C=2}), and 20bp (\code{C=50}) for WGBS data. If \code{lambda} is too small or \code{C} too large then the kernel estimator will not have enough support to significantly differentiate the weighted estimate from the null distribution. If \code{lambda} is too large then \code{dmrcate} will report very long DMRs spanning multiple gene loci, and the large amount of support will likely give Type I errors. If you are concerned about Type I errors we recommend using the default value of \code{pcutoff}, although this will return no DMRs if no DM CpGs are returned by \code{limma/DSS} either.

\value{
  A list containing 2 data frames (\code{input} and \code{results}) and a numeric value (\code{cutoff}). \code{input} contains the contents of the \code{annot} object, plus calculated \emph{p}-values:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{ID}: As per annotation object input
    \item \code{stat}: As per annotation object input
    \item \code{CHR}: As per annotation object input
    \item \code{pos}: As per annotation object input
    \item \code{betafc}: As per annotation object input
    \item \code{raw}: Raw \emph{p}-values from the significance test
    \item \code{fdr}: Adjusted \emph{p}-values from the significance test
    \item \code{step.dmr}: Vector denoting the start of a new DMR (TRUE), 
    constitutive of a DMR, but not the start (FALSE), or non-DMR (NA).
  }
  \code{results} contains an annotated data.frame of significant
  regions, ranked by \code{Stouffer}:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{coord}: Coordinates of the significant region in
      hg19. IGV- and UCSC-friendly.
    \item \code{no.cpgs}: Number of CpG sites constituting the significant
      region. Tie-breaker when sorting by \code{Stouffer}.
    \item \code{minfdr}: Minimum adjusted \emph{p}-value from the CpGs constituting the
      significant region.
    \item \code{Stouffer}: Stouffer transformation of the group of 
      limma- or DSS-derived fdrs for individual CpG sites as DMR constituents.
    \item \code{maxbetafc}: Maximum absolute beta fold change within the region
    \item \code{meanbetafc}: Mean beta fold change within the region.
  }
  \code{cutoff} is the signficance \emph{p}-value cutoff provided in the call to \code{dmrcate}.
